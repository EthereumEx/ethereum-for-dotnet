# ethereum-for-dotnet
A simple, quick (but not dirty) library to use Ethereum Geth RPC endpoint from .Net

It wraps GETH JsonRPC api in an easy to used C# library. 

I use VisualStudio 2017 to develop it.
Both projects target .Net 4.5.2 but code should be easy to compile for an older version. 

## EthereumGethRpc
The main project containing the library itself. 

## EthereumWeb3ProtoClient
a command line exe to test api. 
Some test works with the local ethereum testchain.
